## Comparative Analysis of Centralized and Decentralized Offshore Electrolysis in the North Sea

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our project on the comparative analysis of centralized and decentralized offshore electrolysis in the North Sea. This repository contains an Excel model.

**README.md**: A detailed description of the project, including the purpose, methodology, and instructions on how to use the Excel model.

**ISGTConferencePaper_Frowijn et al.(2024) supplementary documentation.xlsx**: The Excel model that contains all the calculations and data for centralized and decentralized electrolysis systems.

### Project Overview

This project aims to provide a comparative analysis of centralized and decentralized approaches to offshore-wind based electrolysis in the North Sea. By evaluating various parameters such as cost and efficiencies, this analysis provides insights into the range of viable cost options for large-scale hydrogen production based on 100+ different scenarios.

### Model

The Excel model included in this repository is designed to:

- **Simulate** the performance of both centralized and decentralized electrolysis systems on a high over level.
- **Calculate** key metrics such as cost total system costs, total hydrogen production, system efficiency, and LCOH (Levelized Cost of Hydrogen).
- **Compare** a system cost comparison for each system configuration .

### How to Use the Excel Model

1. **Download** the `ISGTConferencePaper_Frowijn et al.(2024) supplementary documentation.xlsx` file.
2. **Open** the file in Microsoft Excel or a compatible spreadsheet application.
3. **Navigate** through the different sheets to explore the variables, modelling, data, and wind source.
   - **Variables**: Select Distance to shore (50, 150, or 150 km), System configuration (three alternatives), and Electrolyzer (PEM or alkaline).
   - **Variables**: Select specific data for the scenario to simulate LCOH of the system configurations.
   - **Modelling**: Sheet were the LCOH is also presented as well as the total hydrogen production (in kg) and system efficiency.
   - **Data**: Overview of all considered data and sources.
   - **wind_source**: Sheet with wind data.
   - **IEA 15 MW RWT**: Sheet with wind power curve.
