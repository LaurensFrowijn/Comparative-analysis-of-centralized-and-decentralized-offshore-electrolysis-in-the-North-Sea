## Comparative Analysis of Centralized and Decentralized Offshore Electrolysis in the North Sea

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our project on the comparative analysis of centralized and decentralized offshore electrolysis in the North Sea. This repository contains an Excel model.

**README.md**: A detailed description of the project, including the purpose, methodology, and instructions on how to use the Excel model.

**Offshore_Electrolysis_Model.xlsx**: The Excel model that contains all the calculations and comparative data for centralized and decentralized electrolysis systems.

### Project Overview

The transition to renewable energy sources has led to increased interest in centralized and decentralized electrolytic hydrogen production. This project aims to provide a comparative analysis of centralized and decentralized approaches to offshore-wind based electrolysis in the North Sea. By evaluating various parameters such as cost and efficiencies, this analysis provides insights into the range of viable cost options for large-scale hydrogen production based on 100+ different scenarios.

### Model

The Excel model included in this repository is designed to:

- **Simulate** the performance of both centralized and decentralized electrolysis systems on a high over level.
- **Calculate** key metrics such as cost total system costs, total hydrogen production, system efficiency, and LCOH (Levelized Cost of Hydrogen).
- **Compare** a system cost comparison for each system configuration .

### How to Use the Excel Model

1. **Download** the `Offshore_Electrolysis_Model.xlsx` file.
2. **Open** the file in Microsoft Excel or a compatible spreadsheet application.
3. **Navigate** through the different sheets to explore the data inputs, calculations, and results.
   - **Input Data**: Enter your specific data or use the default values provided.
   - **Calculations**: Review the automated calculations based on the input data.
   - **Results**: Analyze the comparative outputs for centralized and decentralized systems.
